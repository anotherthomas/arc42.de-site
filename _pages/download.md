On this page you find all available arc42 template downloads,
various [formats]({{page.url}}#format-overview) for various tools. For an overview of these formats, see [below]({{page.url}}#format-overview).

{% assign GITHUBDIR = "https://github.com/arc42/arc42-template/raw/master/dist/" %}
{% assign PREFIX = "https://github.com/arc42/arc42-template/raw/master/dist/arc42-template-" %}

## File-based formats

{% assign formats = "docx|asciidoc|markdown|markdownMP|latex|html|rst|textile" | split: "|"  %}  
{% assign types = "plain|withhelp" | split: "|"  %}  

| Format | Language | Plain | With Help |
|--------|----------|-------|-----------|
{% for format in formats %}| {{ format }} | EN | {% for type in types %} [.zip]({{PREFIX}}EN-{{type}}-{{format}}.zip) |{% endfor %}
|  | DE | {% for type in types %} [.zip]({{PREFIX}}DE-{{type}}-{{format}}.zip) |{% endfor %}
|  | ES | {% for type in types %} [.zip]({{PREFIX}}ES-{{type}}-{{format}}.zip) |{% endfor %}

## Confluence format
Confluence versions are generated _with help_ and come in
two flavors:

* flat: all sections on a single page
* structured: one Confluence page per arc42-section


| Language | flat | structured |
|----------|------|------------|
| DE | [.zip]({{PREFIX}}DE-withhelp-confluenceFlat.zip) | [.zip]({{PREFIX}}DE-withhelp-confluenceStructured.zip) |
| EN | [.zip]({{PREFIX}}EN-withhelp-confluenceFlat.zip) | [.zip]({{PREFIX}}EN-withhelp-confluenceStructured.zip) |
| ES | [.zip]({{PREFIX}}ES-withhelp-confluenceFlat.zip) | [.zip]({{PREFIX}}ES-withhelp-confluenceStructured.zip) |

These versions are generated for the latest version of confluence
(we test with our own [cloud-hosted confluence](https://arc42-template.atlassian.net/)
  provided by Atlassian.)

**Notes for Confluence users**

* We are operating a public confluence - as (briefly) described [here](/confluence-info).

* If you consider to use confluence, the [asciidoc2confluence](https://github.com/rdmueller/asciidoc2confluence) script might be helpful.

* There is also a [confluence plugin available from the atlassian market place](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.networkedassets.plugins.space-blueprint/server/overview).

## Legacy Version (arc42 v6) for Confluence  

If you still use confluence version 4 or 5, these legacy downloads might help you

| Confluence version | Language  | With Help |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
|5.x | EN |  [.zip]({{GITHUBDIR}}legacy/templateEN-V6-confluence-53.xml.zip)|
|>4.3 | EN | [.zip]({{GITHUBDIR}}legacy/templateEN-V6-confluence-43.xml.zip)|
|5.x | DE | [.zip]({{GITHUBDIR}}legacy/templateDE-V6-confluence-53.xml.zip)|
|>4.3 | DE | [.zip]({{GITHUBDIR}}legacy/templateDE-V6-confluence-43.xml.zip) |

These legacy versions have been provided (thanx!) by arc42 users - and can
not be supported by us (as we don't have access to these legacy Confluence versions).

## Enterprise Architect&copy; format
Enterprise Architect;copy; is a commercial UML modeling tool by
SparxSystems.

The Enterprise-Architect version of arc42 contains only the diagram-intensive parts
of the arc42 structure without help text. It's available in EN only.

Please use this format only as a companion to any textual or wiki format,
as it does not contain any explanations or rationales. Put your diagrams
into an EA model, but text and tables should be created, kept and maintained
differently.

## Formats for other modeling tools
We currently don't support additional modeling tools - but would love to...
In case you use arc42 with such a tool, please think about contributing :-)

## Format overview

**docx**
: Microsoft Word, usable with LibreOffice or OpenOffice

**asciidoc**
: Powerful yet simple markup language, used by arc42 itself. Ideally suited for architecture documentation. See
[docToolchain](https://rdmueller.github.io/docToolchain/) or the [original source](https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/).

**markdown**
: Widespread and simple markup language, [documented here](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) by its inventor.

**markdownMP**
: Same format as **markdown** above but every chapter is located in its own file.

**gitHubMarkdown**
: GitHub Flavored Markdown is a dialect of Markdown that is used on GitHub.com and GitHub Enterprise. See the [article here](https://help.github.com/categories/writing-on-github) .

**gitHubMarkdownMP**
: Same format as **gitHubMarkdown** above but every chapter is located in its own file.

**latex**
: No, not the rubber stuff, but the mother (despite TeX)
of all markup languages, a full-blown [document preparation system](https://www.latex-project.org/). For those who need beauty and are willing
to invest some effort...

**rst**
: [ReStructuredText](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html),  markup language, heavily used by [ReadTheDocs](https://readthedocs.org/) and in the Python world.

**textile**
: Another simple markup language, [well-documented](https://txstyle.org/). 

**html**
: Used only to _view_ the template, not to work with it.

**Confluence**
: A commercial wiki system (by [Atlassian Inc.](https://confluence.atlassian.com/alldoc/atlassian-documentation-32243719.html)).
